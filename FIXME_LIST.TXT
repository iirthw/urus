FIXME:

* When on OS X, after build.sh and start.sh in Xcode you need to select target properties "Build Phases";
  And in Link Binary With Libraries add OpenGL.framework and GLUT.framework.
  First, we can automate this process. Second, OpenGL and GLUT shipped with OS X might not be a proper libs
  to use (core profile support, api and extensions) therefore we need to consider using freeglut.
  Third, keep in mind migation to Metal on OS X instead of OpenGL.
