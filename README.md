A simple OpenGL 4.3.0 and GLSL 4.30 example using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, FreeGlut and GLEW
====================================

## Description

The world seems to need another simple OpenGL example running on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 using FreeGlut and GLEW. 
The example is a port of https://github.com/beelsebob/Cocoa-GL-Tutorial, since that was the most simple example I could find. 
The example also uses source code from the book "Interactive Computer Graphics - A Top-Down Approach with OpenGL" by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner (Sixth Edition, Addison-Wesley 2012) (source code can be found here: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/CODE/ ).



## Installation

I assume that you have FreeGlut and GLEW installed in the most recent version.

http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ (MSVC version: http://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/ )

http://glew.sourceforge.net/

Also the code requires that your graphics cards drivers supports OpenGL 4.3.
